# Garment Printing App

## Description
This solution was conceived as a way to help a garment print shop cut down on time that sales staff spent having to take potential customer's through the printing process.

The solution uses code in the functions file of a WordPress child theme. A front end uses JavaScript to FETCH data from a WooCommerce backend based on a user's first choice. Various options in the printing process are presented to the user thus taking them through the process. Ultimately this would result in the user being closer to the final step of getting their garment printed.
